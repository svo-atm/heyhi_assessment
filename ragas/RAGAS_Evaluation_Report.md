# Chatbot Evaluation Results

## Summary

I tested the educational chatbot using RAGAS evaluation metrics. Good news: 3 out of 4 metrics passed! The chatbot is mostly ready but needs some work on staying factual.

## Results

| Metric | Score | Pass? |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Faithfulness | 75.0% | ❌ No (needs 80%+) |
| Answer Relevancy | 86.9% | ✅ Yes |
| Context Precision | 84.0% | ✅ Yes |
| Context Recall | 86.7% | ✅ Yes |

## What This Means

**The Good:**
- Chatbot gives relevant answers to student questions
- Finds the right information from the textbook content
- Recalls comprehensive information when needed

**Needs Work:**
- Sometimes adds information that's not directly supported by the source material
- Need to make it stick closer to the facts from the textbook

## Test Details

- **Date:** July 15, 2025
- **Questions tested:** 10 (covering cell biology topics)
- **Framework:** RAGAS evaluation system

## What We Tested

I asked the chatbot questions about:
- Basic cell biology (what are cells, why they matter)
- Historical discoveries (Robert Hooke's work)
- Scientific tools (microscopes)
- Cell structures (protoplasm, cytoplasm)
- How cells work like factories
- Out-of-scope questions (to test refusal handling)

## Next Steps

To improve the faithfulness score:
1. Update the chatbot's instructions to stick closer to source material
2. Add better fact-checking against the textbook content
3. Reduce any tendency to add extra information not in the source

The chatbot is on the right track and should work well for students once we fix the faithfulness issue.
