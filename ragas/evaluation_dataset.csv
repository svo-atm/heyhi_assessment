What are cells and why are they called the building blocks of life?,"Cells are the basic units of life. All living things are made up of billions of tiny cells, just like a building is made of bricks. That‚Äôs why cells are called the building blocks of life! üß±

Cells are the simplest parts of living things that can do all the jobs needed to stay alive. Inside each cell, many tiny parts work together, just like different departments in a factory. These parts help the cell take in materials, make new things, and give energy to the body.

So, just as bricks build a house, cells build all living things!","['# How Did Cells Get Their Name?\n\nThe term ‚Äòcells‚Äô was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.

What is protoplasm and what are its main components?,"Protoplasm is the living, jelly-like substance inside a cell. It is where many important activities that keep the cell alive and growing happen.

2. **Cytoplasm** ‚Äì This is the jelly-like part that fills the inside of the cell. Most cell activities happen here.

What did Robert Hooke actually observe when he looked at cork?,"When Robert Hooke looked at cork under his microscope, he saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. These were actually the walls of dead plant cells. He did not see the living parts of the cells‚Äîonly the empty spaces and their walls.

What are micrographs and how are they created?,"Micrographs are pictures taken of objects seen through a microscope. They help us see things that are too small for our eyes to see.

To create a micrograph, a camera is attached to a microscope. When you look at something under the microscope, you can take a picture of it using the camera. This picture is called a micrograph.

- If the picture is taken with a light microscope, it is called a light micrograph and can be in color.
- If the picture is taken with an electron microscope, it is called an electron micrograph and is black-and-white (but can be colorized later).

So, micrographs are special photos that show us the tiny world inside cells! üì∑üî¨","['# Chapter 1\n\n# Cells and the Chemistry of Life\n\n# 1.1 What Are Cells?\n\nHow Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?

Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!\n\n- Light microscopes magnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)).\n- Electron microscopes magnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times) (Figure 1.2(b)).\n\nA camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures.

How do different cell structures work together?,"Different cell structures work together like a team to keep the cell alive and healthy. Each part of the cell has a special job, and together they help the cell do everything it needs to do.

Here‚Äôs how some cell structures work together:

- **The nucleus** is like the boss. It controls what the cell does and gives instructions.
- **The cytoplasm** is the jelly-like area where most cell activities happen.
- **Mitochondria** are like power stations. They provide energy for the cell‚Äôs activities.
- **Ribosomes** make proteins, which are needed for building and repairing cell parts.
- **The cell membrane** is like a gatekeeper. It controls what goes in and out of the cell.
- **The Golgi body** packages and sends out substances made in the cell.
- **Vacuoles** store water, food, and other materials.

All these parts work together, just like different departments in a factory, to make sure the cell can survive, grow, and do its job in the body! üè≠üß´‚ú®","['An organ consists of more than one kind of tissue, all working together to perform a specific function.
