# 1.1 What Are Cells?

How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell? Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!

- Light microscopes magnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)).
- Electron microscopes magnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times) (Figure 1.2(b)).

A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.

- Light micrographs can come out as colour images.
- Electron micrographs are black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.

# Imagining Cells as Chemical Factories

All living things are made up of billions of tiny cells, just as a building is made of bricks. Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life. What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:

- A cell takes in raw materials.
- Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.
- These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the body.

In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body.

# How Did Cells Get Their Name?

The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667. He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the bark of a tree (Figure 1.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.

# What Does a Cell Consist Of?

A cell is a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm. While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm (Greek: protos = first; plasm = form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance. Many chemical activities that allow the cell to survive and grow are carried out in the protoplasm.

Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.



# Chapter 1

# Cells and the Chemistry of Life

# Cell Structure and Organisation

The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane (also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 1.4).

# Cytoplasm

The cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur.

Cells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

# What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?

The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelle is specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.

# Word Alert

Mitochodrion: singular for mitochondria

Lipids: biological molecules that are not soluble in water. Examples of lipids are fats, waxes and oils.

# Cell Membrane

The cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipids and proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell.

# Cell Wall

A plant cell also has a cell wall that encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells.

# Nucleus

The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section.

# These are the functions of the nucleus:

- It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.
- It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide.

The terms ‘cell surface membrane’ and ‘cell membrane’ are used in this book to refer to the membrane enclosing the entire cell. Organelles inside the cell are also enclosed by their own membranes.

# Chapter 1

# Cells and the Chemistry of Life

# Cell Structure and Organisation

To see the individual parts of the nucleus clearly, we will need to use an electron microscope (Figure 1.7).

# Ribosomes

Ribosomes are small round structures. They are either attached to the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) or lie freely in the cytoplasm (Figure 1.6 on page 5). They are needed to synthesise proteins in the cell.

- Each chromosome is a long thread-like structure found within the nucleus. (A human cell contains 46 chromosomes.)
- It is made up of proteins and a compound called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. Hereditary information is stored in DNA. DNA carries instructions that a cell needs for carrying out its activities.
- When the cell is dividing, the chromosomes condense and shorten to become thick, rod-shaped structures.

Figure 1.8 shows the appearance of chromosomes during cell division.

# Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum

Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) consists of a network of flattened spaces lined with a membrane (Figure 1.9). (Greek: endoplasm = within the cytoplasm; reticulum = network).

- Its surface appears rough when viewed under the electron microscope. This is because small particles called ribosomes are attached to its outer surface (Figure 1.10).
- The outer surface of the RER is continuous with the nuclear membrane.

# Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum

Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) does not have ribosomes attached to its membrane. SER is more tubular than RER (see Figure 1.11). It is connected to the RER.

- The SER synthesises substances such as fats and steroids (sex hormones in mammals are steroids).
- It converts harmful substances into harmless substances through a process known as detoxification.

# Golgi Body

The Golgi body (also known as Golgi apparatus) is shaped like a disc. It consists of a stack of flattened spaces surrounded by membranes. Vesicles (tiny spherical spaces enclosed by a membrane) can be seen fusing with one side of the Golgi body and pinching off from the opposite side (Figure 1.12).

- The Golgi body chemically modifies substances made by the ER.
- It stores and packages these substances in vesicles for secretion out of the cell.



# Chapter 1

# Cells and the Chemistry of Life

# Cell Structure and Organisation

Figure 1.13 shows how substances made by the ER are moved out of the cell. Compare the general structure of the plant cell (Figure 1.15(a)) with that of the animal cell (Figure 1.15(b)). Do you notice any difference(s) between the two cells?

Vesicles transport substances within the cell. Small vesicles containing substances made by the ER are pinched off from the ER. These vesicles then fuse with the Golgi body and release their contents into the Golgi body. The substances made by the ER may be modified inside the Golgi body: The secretory vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and their contents are released out of the cell:

| smooth endoplasmic reticulum    | chloroplast (only in plant cells) | mitochondrion | vacuolar membrane | nucleus | rough endoplasmic reticulum | free ribosome | Golgi body | vesicle |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| cell wall (only in plant cells) | vacuole                           |               |                   |         |                             |               |            |         |

Figure 1.15 Diagrams of cells as seen under an electron microscope

How substances made by the endoplasmic reticulum enter the Golgi body and are finally secreted out of the cell.

# Chloroplasts

Chloroplasts are oval structures found in plant cells (Figure 1.16).

- Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll.
- Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make food (see Chapter 12).

# Mitochondria

Mitochondria (singular: mitochondrion) are small oval or sausage-shaped organelles (Figure 1.14). Aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria. During aerobic respiration, food substances are broken down to release energy (see Chapter 7). This energy may be used by the cell to perform cell activities such as growth and reproduction.

Figure 1.14 Mitochondrion

A vacuole is a fluid-filled space enclosed by a partially permeable membrane. Vacuoles store substances within the cell. Plant cells have a large central vacuole which contains a liquid called cell sap. Cell sap contains dissolved substances such as sugars, mineral salts and amino acids. Animal cells have many small vacuoles that contain water and food substances. These vacuoles usually exist temporarily.

# Differences Between Plant and Animal Cells

Aim: To examine animal cells using a light microscope

# Procedure

1. Place a drop of methylene blue on a clean microscope slide.
2. Gently scrape the inside of your cheek with a blunt end of a clean toothpick. Swirl the toothpick end in the drop of methylene blue.
3. Carefully lower a cover slip at an angle over the slide.
4. Examine the cells on the slide under a light microscope.
5. Draw one cheek cell and label it as fully as you can.

Helpful Note: Methylene blue is a dye that stains structures in a sample, making parts of the cell more visible.

# Observation

Figure 1.17 shows human cheek cells viewed under the light microscope.

# Discussion

1. Compare your drawing with the diagram of an animal cell in Figure 1.4 on page 4. Which structures shown in Figure 1.4 are not visible under the light microscope?
2. Why must the cover slip be lowered at an angle in step 3?

# Let’s Investigate 1.2

# Aim

To examine plant cells using a light microscope

# Procedure

1. Take a fleshy scale leaf from an onion bulb and bend the leaf until it breaks into two. Gently peel off the skin, called the epidermis, from the inner surface of the leaf using a pair of forceps.
2. Place the epidermis on a clean glass slide.
3. Add a drop of iodine solution (or methylene blue) in the middle of the slide. Carefully lower a coverslip at an angle over the slide.
4. Examine the epidermis under the microscope.
5. Draw one epidermal cell and label it as fully as you can.

# Observation

Figure 1.18 shows onion epidermal cells viewed under the light microscope.

# Discussion

1. How does this cell differ from the plant cell in Figure 1.5 on page 4?
2. State two differences between plant and animal cells that are visible under the light microscope.

Cells are the basic units of life. The different organelles of a typical plant and animal cell carry out specific cellular processes. The differences in organelles found in plant and animal cells can explain the differences in functions between plants and animals.

A tissue is a group of cells with similar structures which work together to perform a specific function. There are two types of tissues: simple tissue and complex tissue. An example of simple tissue is the muscular tissue. Complex tissues contain more than one type of cells, e.g. blood and xylem.

An organ consists of more than one kind of tissue, all working together to perform a specific function. Examples of organs are the stomach and leaf.

An organ system consists of several organs working together for a common purpose. Examples of organ systems in humans include the digestive system, circulatory system, respiratory system and transport system. In plants, examples of organ systems include the root system and the shoot system. Various systems together make up the entire body of an organism.



# Chapter 1

# Let’s Practise 1.1

Some cells develop special structures or lose certain structures to enable them to carry out specific functions. This process of development is called differentiation.

Differentiation is the process by which a cell becomes specialised for a specific function.

1. State the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles in the cell:
2. - (a) chloroplasts
- (b) Golgi body
- (c) mitochondria
- (d) ribosomes

# Plant Tissue Culture Scientist

Plant cells have an amazing ability to develop into an entire plant. This ability is called cellular totipotency. Plant tissue culture scientists make use of this ability to develop plants in the laboratories from plant tissue culture (Figure 1.22). This method reduces the time to produce new varieties, as compared to traditional breeding methods.

Plant tissue culture has far-reaching applications, especially in agriculture. Specific breeds of plants that are resistant to diseases can now be produced in large numbers. In forestry, this technique is useful for large scale propagation of forest trees.

How do you think this technique can help our environment and improve the lives of people in less developed countries?

Scientists may be able to make a three-dimensional model of an organ in the laboratory by using cells that form the particular organ. However, many natural biological reactions taking place in an organ system cannot be reproduced in a model. Tissue engineers can now study a variety of natural biological reactions in an organ by placing the respective cells on a microchip. A simplified model for study is created in this way.

These do not look anywhere near how our natural organs may look, but they are functional and they enable scientists to study the processes that take place in each organ, with almost complete control within the laboratory.

Find out more about the benefits of using models to study processes in the human body.

Let's explore some ideas about cells (Figure 1.23). Are all cells in an organism the same? Which student is correct?

# CELLS

While cells can have different structures, they have the same function. All cells are different but they perform different functions to serve their different functions.

In recent years, scientists have developed several other methods of using cells to treat different diseases. These methods use a special type of cell called stem cells. Stem cells, unlike other cells in the body, are not specialised cells and thus have the ability to develop into other specialised cell types (Figure 1.25). This opens up a whole range of possibilities. Cells of different organs can be potentially grown in the laboratory and transplanted into the organs of humans. A patient's immune cells could be modified to recognise cancerous cells in the lymph nodes and destroy them.

There are still a lot of challenges that scientists need to overcome. In the near future, we may be able to make use of cells to treat diseases that were once considered untreatable.

# 2.1 What Is Diffusion?

In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradient between A and B.

# Learning Outcomes

- Define diffusion and describe its role in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and humans.
- Describe the factors that affect the rate of diffusion.

# Diffusion

Imagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.

Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place.

Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particles

In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.

- Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.
- The steeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.

Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.

Note: Helpful Net movement refers to the overall movement of particles. Net movement of particles occurs when the movement of particles in one direction is greater than the movement of particles in the opposite direction.

When the two regions have the same number of particles per unit volume, the movement of the particles between the two regions will be the same in both directions. Thus, there will be no net movement.

# Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion

1. Using the concept of concentration gradient, explain why the blue colour of copper(II) sulfate gradually spreads throughout the water in the jar.
2. When does diffusion stop?

The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:

- concentration gradient
- diffusion distance
- surface area-to-volume ratio

How concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.

# Diffusion Distance

The time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher.

# Diffusion Across a Membrane

In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.5. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells.

As a result:

- The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.
- The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.

Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane.

| LEFT SIDE                                   | RIGHT SIDE                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| (higher concentration of potassium nitrate) | (higher concentration of copper(II) sulfate) |

In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

# Disciplinary Idea

Living organisms rely on diffusion to facilitate the exchange of gases with the environment needed for survival.

# Gas Exchange of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide via Diffusion

Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.

# Surface Area-to-volume Ratio

Let’s explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.

What does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell? Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?

The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive.

The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.

The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios.

Each shaded square represents the surface area of a unit volume of protoplasm.

# Let’s Investigate 2.2

# Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios

1. Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.
2. Complete Table 2.1.

| Cube                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1 cm                                                           | 2 cm                      | 3 cm |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---- |
| Cell A with sides of 1 cm                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Cell B with sides of 2 cm                                      | Cell C with sides of 3 cm |      |
| Portion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A. | The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells. |                           |      |

How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?

Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8. Each represents a cell. Cells A and B have the same volume of 1 cm³ but have different surface areas. What is the surface area-to-volume ratio for cells A and B?

| Cell A                              | Cell B                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Surface area = 6 cm²                | Surface area = 10 cm²                  |
| Volume = 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm³ | Volume = 2 cm × 2 cm × 0.25 cm = 1 cm³ |

From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm² of surface area to 1 cm³ volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease.

# Cells and the Chemistry of Life

# Movement of Substances

Some cells are specifically adapted to absorb substances, for example, root hair cells and the epithelial cells, which line the small intestine (Figure 2.9). Such cells often have long narrow protrusions or folds in their membranes. These greatly increase the surface area-to-volume ratio of the cell membrane through which materials can be absorbed into the cell. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5.

Recall what you have learnt in Chapter 1.

Now, look at Figure 2.11. What do you notice? What do you think is taking place? Comment on the statements made by the three persons about the movement of molecules.

The tea molecules will stay where they are and not move until they gain enough energy from the hot water. Both the tea molecules and water molecules will move about in the pot.

# What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?

The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.

When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established. Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

# Link

We learn that the concentration of a solution is given by the amount of a solute dissolved in a unit volume of the solution. The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis.

| more solute;          | less solute, higher water potential |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| lower water potential |                                     |

water potential gradient established

water molecules move down a water potential gradient through a partially permeable membrane

# Figure 2.17

# Chapter 2

# Cells and the Chemistry of Life

# Movement of Substances

Figure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane.

When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell). A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall.

# Tech Connect

In Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis. Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.

Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore?

Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:

- water potential gradient
- distance over which water molecules need to move
- surface area-to-volume ratio

# How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?

A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances. Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.

Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.



# Chapter 2

# Cells and the Chemistry of Life

# Movement of Substances

What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?

When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell). A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22).

Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?

Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts.

The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24).

As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential.

Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis.

Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).

Helpful Note: Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

| Normal red blood cell                               | Crenated red blood cell                                 |

How can we show osmosis in living tissues (scape)? A scape (leafless flower stalk), e.g. Chinese leek, can also be used to demonstrate osmosis in living tissue. Figure 2.28(a) shows a section of a scape. A scape has two main layers of cells; the outer epidermal cells and the cortical cells. Only the outer epidermal cells are covered by a waterproof cuticle that protects the plant tissue against water loss. One cut strip is placed in water and another in concentrated sucrose solution (Figure 2.28(b)).

How do cells of the small intestine carry out nutrient uptake? Read Chapter 5 to find out.

# Where Does Active Transport Occur?

Active transport occurs only in living cells because living cells respire. It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.

In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.

In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution.

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Energy            | Energy is required during active transport to ensure that substances can be transported against a concentration gradient, which is critical for many biological processes. |

Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient. Such a process requires energy and is called active transport.

Active transport is the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.

# What You Will Learn

The Need for Food and Water

All living organisms need food. The food we eat contains nutrients that are essential for us. Nutrients include water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are three major types of biological molecules found in living organisms. Water is an essential component of all body tissues. About 70% of our body weight is water. Hence, water is extremely important to life.

Helpful Note

Water has several important functions. It dissolves substances for chemical reactions that take place in living things. In plants, water is essential for photosynthesis, to keep cells turgid or firm, and to transport mineral salts. In humans, water helps to regulate body temperature and transport dissolved substances within the body. Drinking enough water is important for various body functions.

# What are carbohydrates?

# What are fats?

# What are proteins?

Carbohydrates are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2:1. For example:

- glucose has the formula C6H12O6 (ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 12H:6O = 2H:1O)
- sucrose (cane sugar) has the formula C12H22O11 (ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 22H:11O = 2H:1O)

Carbohydrates may be classified as single sugars, double sugars or complex carbohydrates.

| Carbohydrates | Sugars         | Complex carbohydrates: |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
|               | Single sugars: | • starch               |
|               | • glucose      | • cellulose            |
|               | • fructose     | • glycogen             |
|               | Double sugars: |                        |
|               | • maltose      |                        |
|               | • sucrose      |                        |

Do you know that marathon runners need to eat a lot of carbohydrates two days before a race? This may include sugary foods. We know that eating too much sugary foods can cause obesity, sometimes even for people who exercise regularly. Why do you think marathon runners still eat these foods?

# Cells and the Chemistry of Life

# Biological Molecules

# Sugars

Glucose is found in plants and animals. Fructose is common in plants but rare in animals. The structure of glucose and fructose can be represented by the diagrams shown in Figure 3.4.

What is water potential? Sugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they will lower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy to do work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3).

# Double Sugars

A double sugar is formed when two single sugars are joined together. Common double sugars are maltose and sucrose.

Maltose (malt sugar) occurs in germinating grains. Maltose consists of two glucose molecules bonded together. The equation below shows how a maltose molecule can be produced from two glucose molecules.

| glucose | glucose | maltose |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |

A sucrose molecule is made up of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule joined together.

| glucose | + | fructose | sucrose |
| ------- | - | -------- | ------- |

The structure of sucrose can be represented in a diagram as shown in Figure 3.5.

# Single Sugars

A single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.

The common single sugars are glucose and fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C₆H₁₂O₆, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules. These different arrangements give the sugars different chemical and biological properties.

# Table 3.1 Occurrence of single sugars

| Single Sugar | Occurrence                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Glucose      | Found in plants and animals           |
| Fructose     | Common in plants, but rare in animals |


# Chapter 3

# Cells and the Chemistry of Life



# How Can We Test for Reducing Sugars?

Glucose, fructose and maltose are also known as reducing sugars. Reducing sugars will produce a red precipitate when boiled with Benedict’s solution (refer to Let’s Investigate 3.1). Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar and will not give a red precipitate with this test.

We learn that a redox reaction is a chemical reaction which involves the oxidation of a substance and the reduction of another substance.

# Let’s Investigate 3.1

# Aim

To test for the presence of reducing sugars in different food samples using Benedict’s solution.

# Procedure

1. Place 2 cm³ of each food sample into a test-tube (Figure 3.6).
2. Add 2 cm³ of Benedict’s solution to the food sample (Figure 3.7).
3. Shake the mixture and place the test-tube in a boiling water-bath for 2–3 minutes (Figure 3.8).

Helpful Note: Record the colour of the solution.

For a solid food sample, e.g. a peanut, break the sample up to release the cell contents. This can be done by crushing the sample in water using a mortar and pestle. The sample can then be tested.

# Observation

Table 3.2 shows the colour changes observed when carrying out the Benedict’s test with increasing amounts of reducing sugar.

| Observation                                                          | Amount Present                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Solution remained blue                                               | No reducing sugar                 |
| Benedict’s solution turned from blue to green                        | Traces of reducing sugar          |
| Benedict’s solution turned from blue to yellow or orange             | Moderate amount of reducing sugar |
| Benedict’s solution turned from blue to red / Red precipitate formed | Large amount of reducing sugar    |

Figure 3.9 shows the colour change from blue to red indicating an increasing amount of reducing sugar present in the solutions.

# Complex Carbohydrates

# What Are Complex Carbohydrates?

A complex carbohydrate is made up of many similar molecules of single sugar joined together to form a large molecule.

Starch, glycogen and cellulose are complex carbohydrates made up of numerous glucose molecules. The glucose molecules are linked in different ways, giving rise to different structures. Hence, starch, glycogen and cellulose have different chemical and biological properties. They also have different roles as shown in Table 3.3.

| Complex Carbohydrate | Structure                                                                                                                                     | Role                                                                                                                                                                          | Occurrence                                                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Starch               | A starch molecule is made up of several thousand glucose molecules joined together.                                                           | It is a storage form of carbohydrates in plants. When needed, it can be digested to glucose to provide energy for cell activities.                                            | Found in storage organs of plants, e.g. potato tubers and tapioca |
| Cellulose            | A cellulose molecule is made up of many glucose molecules joined together. The bonds between glucose units are different from that in starch. | The cellulose cell wall protects plant cells from bursting or damage. Cellulose cannot be digested in our intestines. They serve as dietary fibre that prevents constipation. | Present in cell walls of plants                                   |
| Glycogen             | Glycogen is a branched molecule. It is made up of many glucose molecules joined together.                                                     | It is a storage form of carbohydrates in mammals. When needed, it is digested to glucose to provide energy for cell activities.                                               | Stored in the liver and muscles of mammals                        |

Helpful Note: Complex carbohydrates such as starch, cellulose and glycogen have different structures (Figure 3.10).

# Tech Connect

Fibre is found in vegetables and fruits. Fibre cannot be digested and we often find food high in fibre difficult to chew. This poses a problem for the elderly, who may not be able to chew food effectively.

Enter the technology of soluble fibre supplements! Engineers have applied their knowledge of what roughage can do for our digestive system. They also understand how roughage can exist as fibres that are soluble in water. The result of this is a powdery substance that we can dissolve in water, or even mix with food or with soup and drink down (Figure 3.11). Some supplements are tasteless and odourless, which makes them highly suitable for the taste-conscious consumer. This is a good example of how engineers create a piece of technology out of what was originally a solution to a problem. The technology comes in the form of an industrial product that is available to the average consumer.

# Glycogen and Starch Are Stores of Glucose

Plants store glucose in the form of starch. Animals cannot make or store starch in their bodies. We get most of our carbohydrates from plants in the form of starch.

# What Are the Functions of Carbohydrates?

Carbohydrates are needed:

- as a substrate for respiration, to provide energy for cell activities;
- to form supporting structures, for example, cell walls in plants;
- to be converted into other organic compounds such as amino acids and fats;
- for the formation of nucleic acids, for example, DNA;
- to synthesise lubricants, for example, mucus, which consists of a carbohydrate and a protein;
- to synthesise the nectar in some flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid that plants produce to attract insects.

# How Can We Test for Starch?

Starch can be detected by the iodine test. A few drops of iodine solution to any substance containing starch will produce a blue-black colour.

# Let’s Investigate 3.2

# Aim

To test for the presence of starch in a food sample using iodine solution.

# Procedure

1. Add a few drops of iodine in potassium iodide solution to a food sample.
2. Record your observations.

# Observation

Iodine solution on the potato turns from brown to blue-black upon contact with starch in the food sample.

# Breakdown of Starch

Starch in the foods we eat may be digested in our alimentary canal. When starch is digested, the bonds within the polysaccharide are broken and the glucose molecules are released.

# Link

How is starch broken down in the gut? Read about it in Chapter 5.

The enzyme amylase digests starch to form the sugar maltose. Amylase cannot break maltose down to glucose. Maltose is hydrolysed to glucose by another enzyme, maltase. Note that complete digestion of starch gives glucose molecules.

# Let’s Practise 3.1

1. Describe how you would test for reducing sugars in a food sample.
2. Describe how you would test for starch in a food sample.
3. Outline the role of carbohydrates in the life of an organism.
4. What do you think will happen if you add some amylase to a starch solution and test the resulting solution with Benedict’s solution after five minutes?

# 3.2 What Are Fats?

# What Are the Sources of Fats?

- Foods that are rich in fats include butter, cheese, fatty meat, olives, many nuts, peas, beans, seeds of castor oil and palm oil (Figure 3.17).
- The meat of most fishes and ‘white meats’ have relatively less fats. However, some fishes such as herring and salmon have lots of fats.

# Learning Outcomes

- List the chemical elements that make up fats.
- State that lipids such as fats are synthesised from glycerol and fatty acids.
- State the main roles of fats for insulation and long-term storage of energy in living organisms.
- Describe and carry out tests for fats (using ethanol).

Have you ever put a bowl or pot of soup in the refrigerator and seen the oil on the surface harden into solids? These are oils or fats (Figure 3.15). Where do they come from, and what does the body do with them?

# Fats

Fats are a type of lipid. Fats, like carbohydrates, are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But unlike carbohydrates, fats contain much less oxygen in proportion to hydrogen. For example, tristearin (beef fat) has the formula C57H110O6. Note how little oxygen it contains in proportion to hydrogen. The proportions of the elements that make up fats are not fixed, so there is no general formula for fats.

Fats can be animal fats or plant fats. Fats are commonly used as a store of energy, especially by animals.

# What Are the Functions of Fats?

How are some animals able to survive in cold climate, while others are not able to? What are the features common to these animals? How do these features help them to survive in the cold?

# Disciplinary Idea

Energy: Fats are one of the energy stores of animals. They are required by living organisms to carry out life processes.

Fats function as:

- A source and a long-term storage of energy. They are a suitable long-term storage material because fats have a higher energy value compared to carbohydrates.
- An insulating material that prevents excessive heat loss. For example, animals such as seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) beneath the skin, which helps to reduce loss of body heat (Figure 3.18).
- A solvent for fat-soluble vitamins and many other vital substances such as hormones.
- An essential part of cells, especially in cell membranes.
- A way to reduce water loss from the skin surface. Glands in the skin secrete an oily substance. This oily substance forms a thin layer over the skin surface, reducing the rate of evaporation of water. The oily substance also reduces the rate of heat loss from the skin.

How does the body control heat loss? Read more about it in Chapter 9.

# Fats Can Be Broken Down into Fatty Acids and Glycerol

Fats can be broken down into simpler compounds such as fatty acids and glycerol. Refer to the general equation shown in Figure 3.16.

The reaction involves an enzyme. For example, when tristearin is broken down by the enzyme lipase, stearic acid and glycerol are produced:

tristearin + lipase → glycerol + three stearic acid molecules (an example of fatty acid)


Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life

# Biological Molecules

# How Can We Test for Fats?

The ethanol emulsion test is a test for the presence of fats. A white emulsion is formed when ethanol and water are added to fats. An emulsion is a suspension of small drops of a liquid in another liquid.

# Learning Outcomes

- List the chemical elements that make up proteins.
- State that polypeptides and protein are synthesised from amino acids.
- State the main roles of proteins for growth and repair of cells in living organisms.
- Describe and carry out tests for protein (using biuret solution).

# Let’s Investigate 3.3

# Aim

To test for the presence of fats in food samples using the ethanol emulsion test.

# Procedure

1. On samples in liquid state (e.g. coconut oil):
1. Add 2 cm³ of ethanol to a drop of liquid sample in a test-tube and shake the mixture thoroughly.
2. Add 2 cm³ of water to the mixture and shake the mixture.
2. On samples in solid state (e.g. peanut):
1. Crush the solid sample into small pieces using a mortar and pestle and place the pieces in a test-tube.
2. Add 2 cm³ of ethanol into the test-tube and shake thoroughly.
3. Allow the solid particles to settle. Carefully decant the ethanol (pour off the top layer of ethanol) into another test-tube containing 2 cm³ of water and shake the mixture.

# Observation

The white emulsion produced indicates the presence of fats. In the absence of fats, the solution will remain clear.

# Let’s Practise 3.2

1. List the chemical elements that make up fats.
2. List three functions of fats.
3. Describe how you would test for fats in a food sample.

# Proteins

Proteins are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Another element, sulfur, may also be present. Proteins are always present in all cells. Their molecules are the largest and most complicated of all the food substances. Proteins are commonly found in the meat of animals.

# Amino Acids — the Building Blocks of Proteins

A protein molecule is built up from simpler compounds known as amino acids. An amino acid is made up of an amino group (–NH₂), an acidic group (–COOH) and a side chain (denoted by R, which may sometimes contain sulfur). The general formula for an amino acid can be written as:

side chain

NHz COOH

amino group acidic group

There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids, for example, methionine and valine. They differ because of their different R groups. Amino acids are combined in various ways to form millions of different protein molecules, just as the 26 letters of the alphabet can be used to form a very large number of words.

# Past to Present

How has our opinion of eating eggs changed over time? In the past, eggs were considered bad for our health and we were discouraged from eating more than two per week. Now, eggs are considered by some nutritionists as the “perfect food”. They are believed to contain all the necessary nutrients that are good for our growth and maintenance of the body. Eggs also contain cholesterol, which is a type of lipid.

What about the discussion on cholesterol intake? Is the amount of cholesterol found in our blood determined by how much cholesterol we take in from food? Or is cholesterol manufactured by our bodies from other types of nutrients? Are all forms of cholesterol bad for our health? Our knowledge of nutrients, and the roles they play in our lives, keeps maturing as we gain a better understanding of how our bodies function.

What attitudes should we embrace as we continue to explore this topic and discover more insights on food and nutrients? How should we behave when these insights from the latest research studies contradict what we thought we knew about the topic?

# How Can We Test for Proteins?

Proteins can be detected by the biuret test. The biuret solution is a blue solution made up of sodium hydroxide and copper(II) sulfate. It turns violet (deep purple) when proteins are present.

# Let’s Investigigate 3.4

# Aim

To test for the presence of proteins in a food sample (e.g. egg white) using biuret solution.

# Procedure

1. To 2 cm³ of liquid food sample (e.g. egg white), add an equal volume of biuret solution.
2. Shake well and allow the mixture to stand for five minutes.
3. Record your observation.

Figure 3.24 A violet (deep purple) colour indicates the presence of proteins. In the absence of proteins, the solution will remain blue.

# Observation

A violet colour indicates the presence of proteins (Figure 3.24).

# What Are the Sources of Proteins?

Proteins can be found in both animal and plant foods. Milk, eggs, seafood and meat, such as chicken and lean beef are some animal foods rich in proteins (Figure 3.23). Plant foods rich in proteins include soya beans, nuts, grains and vegetables such as French beans.

# What Are the Functions of Proteins?

Proteins are used in the:

- synthesis of new cytoplasm, for growth and repair of worn-out body cells;
- synthesis of enzymes and some hormones; and
- formation of antibodies to combat diseases.

# Let’s Practise 3.3

1. (a) List the chemical elements that make up proteins.
2. (b) List three functions of proteins.
3. Describe how you would test for proteins in a food sample.
4. Food tests were carried out on three different foods, labelled A, B and C. The results of the tests are given in Table 3.4.

# How Can We Identify the Different Nutrients Present in Our Food?

You can carry out food tests on a variety of foods, for example, peanut, cucumber, onion, tomato and banana in order to find out what nutrients they contain. The following points in Let’s Investigate 3.5 are worth noting.

# Let’s Investigate 3.5

1. To test a food for presence of reducing sugars or proteins, cut the food into small pieces or grind up the food with a pestle and mortar (Figure 3.25). This helps to break the cells and release the food substances so as to make a concentrated solution for testing.
1. Place some crushed pieces of food in a test-tube. Add 2 cm³ of water to the test-tube to dissolve the sugars and proteins in the food.
2. Decant the solution into another test-tube.
3. Perform Benedict’s or biuret test with the solution. (Refer to Let's Investigate 3.1 and 3.4 respectively.)
2. To test for starch, use the iodine test in Let’s Investigate 3.2.
3. To test for fats, use the ethanol emulsion test in Let’s Investigate 3.3.

# Cool Career

# Nutrition Coach

Nutrition coaches work with their clients to guide them towards a healthy lifestyle (Figure 3.26). They help their clients to incorporate healthy eating behaviours into their lifestyle. To be successful at this, nutrition coaches need to have a good knowledge of what nutrients can do for our health. They must have a good understanding of human behaviour, especially when people are faced with changes in life. They can incorporate healthy diets into the programmes to build the physical fitness of their clients.

# Now, look at Figure 3.27.

Do you agree with what is said here? Why or why not?

Figure 3.27 Three friends are having a discussion about nutrients. Who do you agree with? Why?

In order to obtain enough protein in our diet, we should eat more meat instead of plant-based foods.

Since the role of carbohydrates is to release energy for our body to function, they are the most important type of nutrient.

# 4.1 What Are Enzymes?

Enzymes Lower Activation Energy

Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed.

The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2).

Imagine a chemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).

Disciplinary Idea: Activation energy is the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed).

Enzymes help to lower the activation energy required to break down large molecules into smaller molecules.

For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.

| potassium chlorate(VII) | strong heat | potassium chloride + oxygen |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |

When potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced. If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off.

Manganese(IV) oxide:

- allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and
- speeds up the reaction.

At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst (Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boiling or by changes in the pH of the solution.

In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes.

# Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts

Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.

Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.

Note: If the overall energy change is negative; there is a decrease in energy content (as shown in graph). If the overall energy change is positive, there is an increase in energy content:

# What Reactions Do Enzymes Catalyse?

Enzymes Either Build Up or Break Down Complex Substances

Some food molecules are large and insoluble in water. These molecules cannot diffuse through the cell membrane.

Enzymes are required to break these large molecules into simpler and smaller substances so that they are:

- soluble in water
- small enough to diffuse through the cell membrane (Figure 4.4)

Enzymes that are involved in digestion are known as digestive enzymes. Examples of digestive enzymes are:

- amylase — digests starch to maltose
- maltase — digests maltose to glucose
- protease — digests proteins to polypeptides, then to amino acids
- lipase — digests fats to fatty acids and glycerol

# What is digestion?

Read more about it in Chapter 5.

# Build up complex substances

# Break down complex substances

Cells build up or synthesise complex substances from simpler ones. For example:

- Amino acids taken into the cells may be used to build up proteins. The cytoplasm contains special enzymes to catalyse such reactions.

Cells break down complex substances to simple substances. For example:

- Large molecules in food are broken down into smaller molecules by digestive enzymes.
- In cell respiration, glucose is broken down to release energy and form carbon dioxide and water. This process involves a series of chemical reactions, each catalysed by a different enzyme. The enzymes act together to completely break down glucose.

Hydrogen peroxide is sometimes produced during chemical reactions in the cells. This substance is toxic to the cells. Both plant and animal cells produce the enzyme catalase to break down hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, hence removing the toxic effect. Catalase is especially abundant in blood and the liver of mammals.

In photosynthesis, glucose is synthesised from carbon dioxide and water. The chemical reactions involved in photosynthesis are controlled by enzymes.

# Figure 4.5 Two types of enzyme-catalysed reactions

From the above functions of enzymes, it is important to note that enzymes catalyse practically all the chemical reactions that occur in an organism. However, enzymes are produced only when they are needed. For example, digestive enzymes are produced only when there is food to digest in the alimentary canal.

# Figure 4.4 Only small molecules such as glucose and amino acids can pass through the cell membrane.

# 4.1 How Are Enzymes Named?

Previously, enzymes were simply named by the persons who discovered them. For example, pepsin (a type of protease) was discovered and named by a scientist, Theodor Schwann (Figure 4.6), who was studying digestive processes. ‘Pepsin’ means ‘to digest’ in Greek. However, naming enzymes this way led to a lot of confusion. Nowadays, enzymes are named according to a scientific system. The name of each enzyme:

- shows the substance on which the enzyme acts
- ends in ‘ase’

For example, lipase refers to an enzyme that acts on lipids.

# 4.2 How Are Enzymes Classified?

Enzymes are classified according to the chemical reactions they catalyse. For example:

- carbohydrases are enzymes that digest carbohydrates
- proteases are enzymes that digest proteins
- lipases are enzymes that digest fats (lipids)

# Let’s Practise 4.1

1. (a) What is an enzyme?

(b) What are the two types of reactions that enzymes catalyse?
2. The unripe fruit of the papaya tree contains a particular type of digestive enzyme that is often used to soften meat.

(a) Infer the kind of organic molecule that this enzyme acts on.

(b) Suggest how the enzyme may cause the effect of softening red meat.
3. Red blood cells contain a common enzyme known as catalase. What do you think would happen if a drop of blood was added to a solution of hydrogen peroxide?

# How Does an Enzyme Work?

Enzymes are highly specific in their action. For example, amylases only act on starch, and not on proteins or fats. Similarly, proteases act only on proteins, and lipases only on fats. This enzyme specificity means that each chemical reaction inside a cell is catalysed by a unique enzyme.


Chapter 4
# Cells and the Chemistry of Life

# Enzymes

An enzyme is specific in its action due to its three-dimensional shape. The ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis explains how the shape of an enzyme affects the way it functions.

# ‘Lock-and-key’ Hypothesis

The substances on which enzymes act are called substrates. For example, protein is the substrate on which a protease acts.

| Disciplinary Idea      | According to the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis, enzyme reactions depend on the presence of active sites (Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves (depressions) or ‘pockets’ on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like a lock and key. The enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key. |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structure and Function | The structure of biological molecules affects their functions. For example, the structure of enzymes affects the substrates that can fit into the active site. This affects the reactions they catalyse.                                                                                                                                                          |

# Active Site

The substance on which the enzyme acts is called the substrate.

# 1

An enzyme has a specific three-dimensional (3-D) shape. It has a depression called the active site.

# 2

Only the substrate with a 3-D shape complementary to that of the active site can fit into the enzyme. This results in the formation of an enzyme–substrate complex. The enzyme is just like a lock and the substrate a key. The substrate fits into the enzyme just like a key fits into a lock. This is called the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis.

# 3

While the substrate is attached to the active site, a chemical reaction occurs. The substrate is converted to the products.

When the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, an enzyme–substrate complex is formed. It is a temporary molecule formed when substrates bind to the enzyme. Reactions take place at the active site to convert the substrate molecule(s) into product molecule(s).

# 4

Later, the products leave the active site. The enzyme molecule remains unchanged and is free to combine again with more substrate molecules. The general equation is: E + S → ES → E + P where E = enzyme, S = substrate(s), P = product(s).

# Characteristics of Enzymes

Enzymes Speed Up Chemical Reactions

Enzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.

Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction.

The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.

At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured. Most enzymes are denatured.

Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis.

# Enzymes Are Specific in Action

Enzymes have active sites. Only substrates with a shape complementary to the active site can fit into the enzymes. When an enzyme binds to its substrate, it forms an enzyme–substrate complex. However, high temperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme and consequently its function.

# Enzymes Are Required in Minute Amounts and Remain Unchanged at the End of Reactions

Enzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in the reactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reaction for a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washing powder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing.

# Enzymes Are Affected by Temperature

Figure 4.10 shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction.

# Let’s Investigate 4.1

# Aim

To find out how temperature affects enzyme action

# Procedure

1. Label and fill test-tubes A₁, B₁, C₁ and D₁ with 5 cm³ of starch solution respectively.
2. Label and fill test-tube D₂ with 3 cm³ of distilled water, and test-tubes A₂, B₂ and C₂ with 3 cm³ of amylase solution respectively.
3. Set up the experiment (see Figure 4.12 on the next page) by placing the test-tubes into water-baths of varying temperatures as shown in the table below.

| Test-tubes       | A₁, A₂ | B₁, B₂ | C₁, C₂ | D₁, D₂ |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Temperature / ˚C | 0      | 37     | 100    | 37     |

After 5 minutes, pour the contents of test-tubes A, B, C and D into test-tubes A, B, C and D, respectively. Shake to mix the contents in each test-tube.
After 1 minute, remove one drop from each solution with a dropping pipette and put it in the well in the plate provided. Then test it with a drop of iodine solution. (The solution turns blue-black if starch is present.)
Continue step 5 at 1-minute intervals until the iodine solution remains brown. This shows that all the starch has been digested.
Record the total time (T) taken (in minutes) for the starch in each test-tube to be completely digested.

Word Alert: Optimum: most favourable

# Enzymes

5 minutes later test sample starch amylase solution with iodine Tech Connect Some COVID-19 vaccines need to be stored at low temperatures for them to be effective. In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as –70 °C.

At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries. These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action.

# Observation

1. The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube A₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.
2. The iodine solution remained brown when test-tube B was tested for starch after T minutes.
3. The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube C₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.
4. The iodine solution turned blue-black when test-tube D₁ was tested for starch at the various 1-minute intervals.

# Conclusion

1 The less time taken to digest starch, the more active the enzyme is. In this investigation, enzyme activity is measured by calculating 1 (the reciprocal of the time taken to digest starch). What can you conclude about the effect of temperature on the activity of amylase from the graph of T against temperature?

# Optimum pH values of some enzymes:

- amylase (a carbohydrase) in saliva: pH 7
- protease in stomach: pH 2
- protease in small intestine: pH 8

# Enzymes Are Affected by pH

Enzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes.

In Figure 4.13, point M indicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.
